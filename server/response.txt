Summary:
This document is a set of lecture notes prepared by the Department of Electrical Engineering at Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla, Odisha, India, for the undergraduate course “Non-Conventional Energy Sources” (Subject Code BEE1703) offered to B.Tech. students in their seventh semester of Electrical Engineering and Electrical & Electronics Engineering. Intended as a complementary teaching resource rather than a primary or commercially marketable text, these notes compile information from various textbooks and open-access internet sources. The committee explicitly disclaims originality, liability for accuracy, and suitability for commercial use, and acknowledges that ownership of material lies with original authors and institutions.

Purpose and Structure  
The principal purpose of the document is to furnish students and instructors with a coherent overview of renewable and non-renewable energy technologies, their classification, deployment, and integration into power systems. It is organized into four modules, each corresponding to approximately ten lecture hours:
• Module I covers the global and Indian energy scenario, energy classification, solar thermal systems, and photovoltaic (PV) technology.  
• Module II addresses wind energy fundamentals, small hydro systems, and the characterization of wind power equipment.  
• Module III explores energy storage options, including batteries, flywheels, fuel cells, and ultra-capacitors, along with bioenergy and biofuels.  
• Module IV examines grid integration of decentralized generation, microgrid concepts, hybrid systems, and associated power quality and stability considerations.

Following the syllabus outline, the notes begin with a foundational discussion of “Energy Scenario,” defining energy, its economic importance, and its environmental impacts. Subsequent sections systematically classify energy into various types and delve into global resource statistics.

Content Summary  
1. Energy Scenario and Classification  
• Definition and Importance: Energy is characterized as the capacity to perform work, derived from the Greek “en-ergon.” The notes emphasize energy’s pivotal role in economic development, particularly in emerging countries where meeting rising energy demand entails substantial investment.  
• Classification Criteria: Energy is categorized along four principal axes—primary versus secondary, commercial versus non-commercial, renewable versus non-renewable, and conventional versus non-conventional.  
  – Primary/Secondary: Primary sources (coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, nuclear, geothermal) are naturally occurring; secondary forms (electricity, steam) result from conversion processes.  
  – Commercial/Non-Commercial: Commercial energy (electricity, refined fuels, coal) is market-priced and underpins industrial and residential growth; non-commercial energy (firewood, dung, agricultural waste, animal power) is gathered traditionally, predominantly in rural settings.  
  – Renewable/Non-Renewable: Renewable sources (solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal) are essentially inexhaustible and environmentally benign; non-renewables (fossil fuels) are finite and entail pollutant emissions.  
  – Conventional/Non-Conventional: Conventional sources refer to long-established fuels (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, large hydro), whereas non-conventional sources (solar, wind, biomass, tidal) gained prominence post the 1973 oil crisis.

• Energy Consumption and Living Standards: Energy use is split across domestic, transportation, agricultural, and industrial sectors. Per-capita consumption serves as a proxy for a nation’s standard of living, reflecting domestic comfort, transport infrastructure, and productive capacity.

• Global Reserves and Consumption Patterns: Citing BP’s 2004 Statistical Review, the notes tabulate proven reserves at the end of 2003—coal (984,453 million tonnes worldwide with 25.4% in the USA), oil (1,147 billion barrels, 23% in Saudi Arabia), and natural gas (176 trillion m³, 27% in Russia). These figures underscore the geographic concentration of fossil resources and reinforce the strategic impetus for diversifying toward renewables.

2. Solar Energy Systems  
• Solar Thermal Collectors: The notes outline various collector types—flat-plate, evacuated tube, and concentrating systems—detailing their construction, operating principles, efficiency metrics, and typical applications (water heating, space heating, industrial process heat). Efficiency calculations are introduced qualitatively, focusing on the balance of optical, thermal, and convective losses.

• Photovoltaic (PV) Technology: Present status of PV technology is reviewed, covering solar cell materials (silicon, thin films), electrical characteristics, equivalent circuit models, and performance curves. Design considerations for PV arrays, including module interconnection, mounting options, and building-integrated PV, are discussed alongside component sizing, economics (capital cost, levelized cost of energy), and peak power operation strategies. Both standalone and grid-interactive PV system architectures are summarized.

3. Wind and Small Hydro Power  
• Wind Energy Fundamentals: The relationship between wind speed and available power (cubic dependence) is explained, alongside statistical models for wind distribution and site assessment.  
• Wind Turbine Components: The document describes rotor types (horizontal and vertical axis), generator choices, control mechanisms for capturing maximum power (tip-speed ratio control, pitch regulation), and electrical load matching. Operational modes—constant versus variable speed—and grid integration aspects are outlined.  
• Small Hydro Systems: Although more briefly treated, the notes mention run-of-river and low-head hydro installations, typical design features, and their suitability for decentralized power supply.

4. Energy Storage and Hybrid Systems  
• Battery Storage: Types (lead-acid, lithium-ion), equivalent circuit parameters, charge/discharge characteristics, and design considerations such as depth of discharge and capacity rating are summarized. Charge regulation and battery management systems receive attention.  
• Flywheels: Energy storage principles based on rotational inertia, key components, and merits (high cycle life, fast response) relative to batteries are highlighted.  
• Fuel Cells and Ultra-Capacitors: Basic operation, applications in renewable energy systems, and comparative advantages are noted.  
• Bioenergy: Biomass conversion routes and biofuels are introduced as renewable liquid and gaseous energy carriers.  
• Hybrid Configurations: The concept of combining storage and generation (solar–wind, solar–diesel, wind–hydro) is presented, emphasizing complementary resource profiles, system sizing, and mode controllers for load sharing.

5. Grid Integration and Microgrids  
• Stand-Alone vs. Grid-Connected: Distinctions between isolated systems (with local generation and storage) and grid-interactive setups are drawn.  
• Microgrid Architecture: Components (generation, storage, control, protection) and operational modes (islanded, grid-tied) are described.  
• Power Quality and Stability: The notes address voltage/frequency regulation, harmonic distortion, voltage transients, flicker, dynamic reactive power support, and stability margins. Interface requirements and safety considerations for seamless integration are discussed.  
• Economics and Operating Limits: Levelized costs for hybrid systems, optimal sizing approaches, and operating envelopes for voltage and frequency are outlined, underscoring the importance of storage and load scheduling in maintaining system stiffness.

Figures and Illustrations  
The text refers to diagrams—such as a schematic of major primary and secondary energy sources and a classification tree for renewable versus non-renewable energy—but does not provide full graphics in the printed pages. These visual aids complement the narrative by mapping energy categories and resource flows.

Overall, the lecture notes offer a comprehensive, modular framework to guide classroom lectures and student study on renewable and conventional energy technologies, resource assessment, system design, storage solutions, and integration challenges. They emphasize broad concepts, fundamental equations, and comparative analyses without prescribing rigid procedural instructions.
