Interfacing standards are formally defined agreements (often published by standards bodies such as IEEE, ISO, IEC or USB-IF) that specify how two or more hardware or software components connect and communicate. Their purpose is to ensure interoperability, reliability and safety across devices or systems from different vendors.  

Key aspects covered by an interfacing standard  
1. Mechanical/Physical – connector shape, pin-out, mounting dimensions (e.g. USB-C, HDMI)  
2. Electrical/Signal – voltage levels, impedance, timing (e.g. RS-232, LVDS)  
3. Protocol/Logical – data‐framing, error-checking, handshaking (e.g. I²C, SPI, Ethernet)  
4. Software/API (when applicable) – call conventions, data formats, versioning (e.g. POSIX, REST/JSON, CORBA)  

Examples of common interfacing standards  
• USB (Universal Serial Bus) – power, data rates and packet formats for peripherals  
• PCI Express – high-speed bus standard for internal computer expansion cards  
• HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) – audio/video transmission over a single cable  
• I²C & SPI – short-distance, on-board chip‐to‐chip communication  
• Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) – wired LAN networking  

By adhering to these standards, designers and manufacturers can be confident that their products will “plug-and-play” with others in the same category without custom wiring or protocol translators.
