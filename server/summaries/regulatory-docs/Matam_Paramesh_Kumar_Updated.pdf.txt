These certifications indicate both breadth and depth in cloud-based AI solutions, as well as an awareness of security considerations in software development.

The achievements section focuses on leadership and event organization. He served as the Secretary of the FACIT Council at REVA University, demonstrating administrative responsibility and community engagement within an academic setting. Additionally, he organized “Khel Khoj,” a sports and talent event, illustrating his capacity to coordinate extracurricular programs and foster team collaboration.

A pivotal portion of the résumé details seven major projects, each illustrating a distinct application of AI, ML, data visualization, or full-stack development:
1. NOVA AI: A voice-interactive personal assistant leveraging OpenAI’s API to understand natural language, respond in real time, and automate workflows. It supports custom commands for both web-based and local system actions.
2. Alzheimer’s Detection using Machine Learning: A healthcare analytics initiative employing Random Forest and neural network models to detect early-stage Alzheimer’s disease from clinical records and medical imaging, achieving high validation accuracy.
3. Hospital Mortality Prediction: A predictive analytics project using ICU clinical data to estimate patient survival probabilities. Models are designed with explainability in mind to support medical decision-making.
4. Conversational Chat-Bot: An NLP-driven chatbot deployed to handle frequently asked questions and automate responses for student inquiries, showcasing skills in text processing and user experience design.
5. Bank Loan Prediction: A financial risk assessment tool built with logistic regression and ensemble learning methods, predicting loan approval outcomes from customers’ demographic and financial profiles.
6. Netflix BI Dashboard: A business intelligence dashboard created in Power BI, visualizing user viewing trends, genre popularity, and engagement metrics to inform content strategy and stakeholder decisions.
7. Bus Booking System: A full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack, enabling online bus ticket reservations with real-time seat availability tracking.

In his professional experience, Mr. Kumar has contributed to two corporate engagements. At Siemens, he participated in a “Medical Data Automation” project, likely involving the extraction, transformation, and analysis of healthcare data to streamline medical workflows. At NTT DATA, he worked on “Sales Forecast Modelling and Dashboarding,” applying predictive modeling techniques and creating visual dashboards to support business forecasting and sales strategy.

His educational background is solidly anchored in a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI & ML at REVA University (2021–2025), where he maintains a strong CGPA of 9.08. His earlier academic record includes a 94.6% score in the intermediate (MPC) program at Sri Chaitanya (2019–2021) and a GPA of 9.8 in secondary school (SSC) at the same institution (2016–2019). This progression highlights consistent academic excellence, particularly in STEM disciplines.

The skills section enumerates both technical and soft competencies. Programming languages include Python, C, Java, C++, SQL, and C#. In AI and ML frameworks, he is proficient with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Hugging Face libraries, and OpenCV. For data manipulation and visualization, he uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Web and application development skills cover FastAPI, Streamlit, the MERN stack, and FlutterFlow. Cloud and DevOps tools listed are Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure ML Studio, Git, and GitHub. Database proficiencies include MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. Soft skills such as public speaking, debugging, and Agile practices round out his professional toolkit.

Mr. Kumar is multilingual, with fluency in English, Hindi, Telugu, and Kannada, which can facilitate collaboration in diverse environments. His personal interests feature national-level participation in badminton, involvement in cricket, and moto vlogging, reflecting both athletic achievement and creative hobbyist pursuits.

Overall, the résumé conveys a well-rounded candidate with strong academic credentials, a diverse portfolio of AI/ML and software development projects, corporate exposure in data-driven roles, and leadership experience in university governance and events. The document’s structured layout enables recruiters to quickly assess technical strengths, project history, and personal attributes, making it suitable for internship applications, entry-level engineering positions, or research collaborations in AI and related fields.
